This project consists in a redesign of @tw2ka work. It is a 6 dof robot arm driven by Stepper motors and belts 
For the steppers i used one Nema23 for the main axis, and nema 17s for the rest of the axis.
For the belts i used gt2 6mm and 10mm belts for everything except the main axis were i used a HTD3M belt
The hardware that controls everything consists in an Arduino Mega and 6x TB6600 stepper drivers 
For the software i'm using the arduino code written by @tw2ka

All credits for the software and the original design go to @tw2ka. You can find him  and the code for this robot arm on Youtube: https://youtu.be/wI4Jh-T0Tlo?si=jc4HXcvwKqrjOzHO
