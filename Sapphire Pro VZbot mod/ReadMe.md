This project consists in a modded Twotrees Sapphire Pro. 

The mods include:
- Two Nema 23 for the XY Gantry
- redesigned Gantry with VZbot Y joints
- Manta M8P with CM4 (running Klipper)
- 24v and 36v PSUs
- MKS THR36 toolhead PCB
- 3 indipendent Z, lead screw driven 
- double 12032 auxiliary fan
- Full Enclosure with magnetic front door
- Voron v0 oled display
- Double Hepa and Carbon filters

I kept the original structural parts such as aluminium extrusions, top and bottom frame pieces. The other pieces and components need to be bought separately (Have a look at the CAD file)
